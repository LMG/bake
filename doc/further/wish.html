<h1>Wishes and planned features</h1>

Features listed on this page are open for discussion.
<ul>
<li>Project configurations are placed in Project.meta. If more than one meta file would be supported, different applications may edit different meta files.
<ul>
	<li>Applications can change e.g. compiler flags without breaking another application.
    <li>However, if e.g. a new include path is needed, all meta-files have to be adapted.
</ul>
<li>bakery: Collections shall be able to reference Collections
<li>Another way to define IncludeDirs, etc. which avoids repeating the work IncludeDir for every include dir (rtext change?)
<li>meta files: "{" not only at the end of a line, should be possible to place anywhere
<li>New lines in problems view are shown as a square sign. These signs should be somehow removed without breaking the annotations in the source files.
<li>Maybe a project property page can be introduced as Project.meta-Viewer/Editor - this could be a feature for a later version.
<li>Global bake config (e.g. for -v or -a black)
<li>Optional show full filenames in compiler output
<li>Support toolchain settings for files with wildcards. Clarify how to proceed with ambiguous declarations.
<li>Word wrap in colored console in Eclipse (seems a bit tricky)
<li>Build order of files currently the same as in Eclipse makefiles. Should that be changed to reflect order of "Files" tags in Project.meta?
<li>bakery shall call bake with relative pathnames, which results in nicer outputs in nightly builds
<li>Introduce background ruby process for Eclipse to workaround the require bug in ruby 1.9.x for Windows.<br>
Reason: require statements take round about two seconds before the build can be started. Two seconds is very much when building a single file.
<li>Exporter: add some more logic for exclude build directories to reduce useless definitions in Project.meta files
<li>Additional redirect from errors and warnings in a log file.
<li>Variables in main Project.meta which are usable in subprojects.
<li>Conditional variables like ifeq ($(VIDEO_MODE_12BIT_JPEG), 1)
<li>Better annotations undefined symbol errors (if e.g. filename is given in error message)
<li>Doxygen parameter to generate Doxygen, maybe with AutoOpen from Eclipse?
<li>VerboseLevel instead if different parameters like --print_less, --verbose, ...  

</ul>
