<h1>Wishes and planned features</h1>

Features listed on this page are open for discussion.
<ul>
<li>Project configurations are placed in Project.meta. If more than one meta file would be supported, different applications may edit different meta files.
<ul>
	<li>Applications can change e.g. compiler flags without breaking another application.
    <li>However, if e.g. a new include path is needed, all meta-files have to be adapted.
</ul>
<li>Another way to define IncludeDirs, etc. which avoids repeating the work IncludeDir for every include dir (rtext change?)
<li>meta files: "{" not only at the end of a line, should be possible to place anywhere
<li>New lines in problems view are shown as a square sign. These signs should be somehow removed without breaking the annotations in the source files.
<li>Maybe a project property page can be introduced as Project.meta-Viewer/Editor - this could be a feature for a later version.
<li>Global bake config (e.g. for -v or -a black)
<li>Support toolchain settings for files with wildcards. Clarify how to proceed with ambiguous declarations.
<li>Word wrap in colored console in Eclipse (seems to be a bit tricky)
<li>Additional redirect from errors and warnings in a log file.
<li>Conditional variables like ifeq ($(VIDEO_MODE_12BIT_JPEG), 1)
<li>Better annotations undefined symbol errors (if e.g. filename is given in error message)
<li>Better error log in Eclipse if plugin does not work

<li>Doxygen support or even better generic docu support


</ul>
