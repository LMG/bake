<h1>Filter configs</h1>

Currently pre and post steps as well as compiler can be filtered.<p>

This can be done by defining a filter name in the config, e.g.:

<pre id="rundrum"><code>ExecutableConfig A {
  PreSteps {
    CommandLine "doSomething /nice", filter: FILTER1
  }
  Toolchain {
    Compiler CPP {
      Define "X=Y", filter: FILTER2
      Define "ABC", filter: FILTER2, default: off
    }
  }
}</code></pre>	

The steps and defines can be forced to be included or excluded with the following command line parameters:

<pre id="rundrum"><code>--include_filter FILTER_ABC
--exclude_filter FILTER_XY</code></pre>	
</body>

The parameters can be used multiple times. If the filter is not explicitly specified on command line, the steps and defines are included per default except they are marked with "default: off", see above.<p>

To include or exclude ALL pre and post steps, two special filter names are defined in bake: "PRE" and "POST".<p>

Please note, that when changing filter names on the command line, the source files will <b>not</b> be recompiled automatically. To do so, you may add a "--rebuild" on the command line.
