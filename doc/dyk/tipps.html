<h1>Tipps and Tricks</h1>

<h3>Syntax highlighting</h3>
To enable syntax highlighting for the Project.meta files in Eclipse, install the "rtext_eclipse_plugin" (Help->Install New Software...) and associate ".meta" files with the rtext editor (Window->Preferences, File Associations page).<br>
An update site for Eclipse (needed for installation) will be provided soon. For now, you can download it manually at github.

<h3>Key bindings</h3>
It is possible to bind the bake commands to keys.<p>

<h3>Unnecessary includes</h3>
If a library or executable is successfully build with "-v", unnecessary includes are printed out:
<pre id="rundrum"><code>Info: Include to ../sub1/include/ seems to be unnecessary
Info: Include to ../sub2/include/ seems to be unnecessary</code></pre>

This features depends on the compiler dependency files. For projects with assembler files, the list might be incorrect.<br>
However, remove the IncludeDir statements from the Project.meta and check it out.

<h3>Symlinks and junctions</h3>
It is possible to use symlinks (Linux) or junctions (Windows) when working with git. Best practice:
<ul>
	<li>Link all used projects into <i>one</i> directory (e.g. from application repository and basis software repository).
	<li>Use this directory when working with bake, Eclipse, etc.
	<li>Specify "-w <i>absolute_path_to_working_dir</i>.
    <li>To sync/commit from/to svn, use the original directories created by git.
</ul>

<h3>Single file</h3>
If you want to build a single file, you have to specify it like that:
<pre id="rundrum"><code>bake -b Debug -f src/abc/MyFile.cpp</pre></code>
No need to type so much! If it's not ambiguous, it's enough to specify parts of the filename like this:
<pre id="rundrum"><code>bake -b Debug -f abc/MyFile.cpp
bake -b Debug -f MyFile.cpp</code></pre>
