<h1>The build hierarchy</h1>

<h2>Build graph</h2>

Depending on the contents of the Project.meta files, a build graph will be generated.
<ul>
    <li>An ExecutableConfig usally specifies files to compile, dependencies to other projects and linker stuff.
    <li>A LibraryConfig usally specifies files to compile and archive.
    <li>A CustomConfig usually defines a custom step.
</ul>
Every config type can be equipped with pre and post steps like shell commands or makefiles.

All these steps will be combined to a build graph.

<h2>Example</h2>

The main project has dependencies to the projects A, B and C:<br>
<img src="hier.png"/>
<br>
Steps are executed bottom-up. If one step fails, all steps above won't be executed.
<p>
If e.g.
<ul>
    <li>PreStepMain 2 fails
    <li>at least one file of library B does not compile
</ul>
then
<ul>
    <li>library B will not be created
    <li>files of the main project will not be compiled
    <li>main project will not be linked
    <li>post step of main project will not be executed
</ul>
